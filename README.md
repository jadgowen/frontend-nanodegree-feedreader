## Instructions

The goal of the Jasmine Feedreader Test project was to establish testing to ensure successful implementation of JavaScript functionality through the use of Jasmine, a test suite designed to provide test results based on successful or unsuccessful functionality.

Verify successful testing on your own by cloning the project [here](https://github.com/jadgowen/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader), then opening the index.html file in the browser of your choice.
